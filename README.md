## A small Rest API 
The goal of this project was to put together a small Rest api that has a couple of different functionalities for creating a personal budget following the envelope budget system.

With this Api you can create new categories with budget amounts, update either category or budget amounts for specific categories, delete a category, transfer a specific amount of money from one to another, or simply check which categories you have already created.

This project comes from Codecademy.com as a part of their Back-End Developer carreer path.
